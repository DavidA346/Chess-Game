    string chessRules = "Pawn The pawn can move only in a forward direction. From its starting position the pawn may be moved one or two squares. However, after that it may be moved only one square at a time. Since the pawn cannot leap over any piece, any chessman directly in front of it blocks further advance of the pawn. A pawn may only capture an enemy piece that is on the square in front of it diagonally. If your pawn is able to reach the end row on the board, you may replace it with any piece (except a king). \nROOK \nThe rook can move either horizontally or vertically (but not both on the same move). \nQUEEN \nThe queen is the strongest piece in the game. It may move in eight directions-commanding all the squares in any of these various directions. It cannot jump over another piece. \nBISHOP \nThe bishop can only move diagonally and in one direction at a move. Each bishop is on a different color and commands that color only. \nCASTLING \nThe only move in the game that allows two pieces to move at once is castling. The two pieces that partake in this are the king and rook. However, there are a few rules that govern this move. A player may 'castle' if: \nA. All the squares between the king and rook are unoccupied. \nB. Neither the rook or king has been moved previously. \nC. None of the opponent's places command the squares between the king and the rook. \nKNIGHT \nThe knight is the only chessman that can move over its own or opponent's pieces. The Knight moves two spaces in a row and one over. \nKING \nThe king may move in any direction-to either color. However, unlike the queen, the king moves \nonly one square at a time. Since the object of the game is to capture the king, the king is not allowed to be moved to a square where he would be liable to be captured by an opposing piece. \nCHECKMATE \nTo win the game of chess, a player must capture the opponent's king. This is known as 'Checkmating' the king. Whenever the king is attacked, he is in check and must be so warned by the opponent. To get out of check the player may either: capture the attacking piece; move the king out of danger; or put another piece\nbetween the attacking chessman and his king. \nDRAWN GAME \nA game is drawn when: \nA. One player cannot 'Checkmate' the other. \nB. There is a 'stalemate.' This happens when a king is not in check, but when his \nonly move (with the king) puts him into check. This differs from a 'checkmate,' where the king is already in check before moving.";
