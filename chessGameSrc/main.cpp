      "Pawn The pawn can move only in a forward direction. From its starting "
      "position the pawn may be moved one or two squares. However, after that "
      "it may be moved only one square at a time. Since the pawn cannot leap "
      "over any piece, any chessman directly in front of it blocks further "
      "advance of the pawn. A pawn may only capture an enemy piece that is on "
      "the square in front of it diagonally. If your pawn is able to reach the "
      "end row on the board, you may replace it with any piece (except a "
      "king). \nROOK \nThe rook can move either horizontally or vertically "
      "(but not both on the same move). \nQUEEN \nThe queen is the strongest "
      "piece in the game. It may move in eight directions-commanding all the "
      "squares in any of these various directions. It cannot jump over another "
      "piece. \nBISHOP \nThe bishop can only move diagonally and in one "
      "direction at a move. Each bishop is on a different color and commands "
      "that color only. \nCASTLING \nThe only move in the game that allows two "
      "pieces to move at once is castling. The two pieces that partake in this "
      "are the king and rook. However, there are a few rules that govern this "
      "move. A player may 'castle' if: \nA. All the squares between the king "
      "and rook are unoccupied. \nB. Neither the rook or king has been moved "
      "previously. \nC. None of the opponent's places command the squares "
      "between the king and the rook. \nKNIGHT \nThe knight is the only "
      "chessman that can move over its own or opponent's pieces. The Knight "
      "moves two spaces in a row and one over. \nKING \nThe king may move in "
      "any direction-to either color. However, unlike the queen, the king "
      "moves \nonly one square at a time. Since the object of the game is to "
      "capture the king, the king is not allowed to be moved to a square where "
      "he would be liable to be captured by an opposing piece. \nCHECKMATE "
      "\nTo win the game of chess, a player must capture the opponent's king. "
      "This is known as 'Checkmating' the king. Whenever the king is attacked, "
      "he is in check and must be so warned by the opponent. To get out of "
      "check the player may either: capture the attacking piece; move the king "
      "out of danger; or put another piece\nbetween the attacking chessman and "
      "his king. \nDRAWN GAME \nA game is drawn when: \nA. One player cannot "
      "'Checkmate' the other. \nB. There is a 'stalemate.' This happens when a "
      "king is not in check, but when his \nonly move (with the king) puts him "
      "into check. This differs from a 'checkmate,' where the king is already "
      "in check before moving.";
